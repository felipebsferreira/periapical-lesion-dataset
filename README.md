# Periapical Lesion Classification Dataset

This dataset consists of 1,000 Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans of healthy and unhealthy teeth. Each sample consists of a pair of images in coronal and sagittal planes. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee, University of Pernambuco, Brazil (certificate : 4.881.124).

Feature images from the dataset, where (a,b) represent a tooth without lesion and are sagittal and coronal sections, respectively; (c,d) represent a tooth with small lesion and are sagittal and coronal sections, respectively; (e,f) represent a tooth with large lesion and are sagittal and coronal sections, respectively:
